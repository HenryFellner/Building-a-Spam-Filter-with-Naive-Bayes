# Building-a-Spam-Filter-with-Naive-Bayes
This project seeks to use basic machine learning to create a filter that classifies new text messages as either spam or non-spam, built using a test-set and a training-set.

The project is made with Python, primarily using pandas dataframes.

It uses a dataset consisting of thousands of text messages that have been classified as either spam or not spam by hand by humans. It converts 80% of this dataset to a training set and the remaining 20% is used as a test-set. Using Naive Bayes, a model is creates purely within python dataframes, not using formal scikit learn algorithms.
